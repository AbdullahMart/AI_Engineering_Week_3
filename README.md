House Prices (End-to-End ML Pipeline)
📌 Project Title
House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle Competition Dataset)

🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the sales price of a house (SalePrice).

By following this project, you will learn:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Reading and exploring the data.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Building a structure with ColumnTransformer and Pipeline.

Model Training: Training and comparing multiple machine learning models.

Cross Validation: Evaluating models reliably.

Overfitting Control: Comparing training vs. validation results.

Model Explainability: Using SHAP to understand how the model works.

Kaggle Submission: Preparing and submitting results.

Error Analysis: Analyzing the mistakes of the model.
